# Advanced C++

C++ is a statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, compiled, general-purpose, powerful programming language. C++ is an object oriented language. It supports features like classes and objects, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Inheritance etc. C++ is also used for hardware design.


Advance Level

1) Classes and Objects in C++

    Defining Classes: create a class
    <br><t> Defining Objects: create an object of the class
    <br><t> Member Functions
    <br><t> To create a function
    <br><t> Encapsulation
    <br><t> Data Abstraction


2) Constructor and Destructor

     Constructor and Destructor
    <br><t> To create a constructor
    <br><t> Parameterized constructors
    <br><t> Default constructor
    <br><t> Destructor


3) static members in C++

    Static Keyword
    <br><t> Static variable
    <br><t> Static member function


4) Inheritance

    Inheritance
    <br><t> Concept of subclass and superclass
    <br><t> Types of inheritance
    <br><t> Single level inheritance
    <br><t> Multilevel inheritance


5) More on Inheritance

     Multiple Inheritance
    <br><t> Derived class inherits from more than one base class
    <br><t> Hierarchical Inheritance
    <br><t> Multiple derived classes inherit from one base class


6) Function overloading and overriding

     Function overloading
    <br><t> Function overriding
    <br><t> Difference between both


7) Polymorphism in C++

     Polymorphism
    <br><t> Virtual Members
    <br><t> Virtual Function


8) Abstract class in C++

    Pure virtual function
    <br><t> abstract methods


9) Friend Function

    friend function


10) Exception Handling

    Exceptions
    <br><t> try
    <br><t> throw
    <br><t> catch
