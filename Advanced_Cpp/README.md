# Advanced C++

C++ is a statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, compiled, general-purpose, powerful programming language. C++ is an object oriented language. It supports features like classes and objects, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Inheritance etc. C++ is also used for hardware design.


Advance Level

1) Classes and Objects in C++

    <br><t> Defining Classes
        <br><t><t> create a class
    <br><t> Defining Objects
        <br><t> create an object of the class
    <br><t> Member Functions
    <br><t> To create a function
